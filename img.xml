        <description>The Arnolfini Portrait is a 1434 oil painting on oak panel by the Early Netherlandish 
        painter Jan van Eyck. It forms a full-length double portrait, believed to depict the Italian merchant 
        Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini and his wife, presumably in their residence at the Flemish city of Bruges.
